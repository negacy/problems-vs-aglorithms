roblem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie
=======================
Since we are using Trie data structre, the time and space complexity would be similr to that of problem 5.

Time complexity: 
---------------
    * `find` and `insert` operations are performed in O(m), where m is length of a URL.


Space complexity:
----------------
Space complexity is O(n*m), where n is character count and m is average length of a URL.
