Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer
====================================

Newthon's method is used (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method) to compute root of an integer. 

Time complexity:
----------------
Time complexity is O(log(n)), where n is the input integer.

Space complexity:
----------------
Space complexity is O(1) since the only memory used during compatation is for th variables x and y.
